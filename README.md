# Turtle Maze Python Game
(Created from mid April 2023 to beginning of May 2023)

The Python Turtle Maze Game is the use of clicking keys on the keyboard to make the turtle cursor move through the maze. The user must try to make it to the end of the maze without hitting any of the lines in order to win the game. If the user hits the lines, they will lose and will have to re-play the game again. The Python Turtle Maze Game is a fun and cool maze game that involves different colors and shapes when playing the Maze game! My group and I had to use Turtle programming in Python in order to create our game for Python class. This game consists of many different features created such as creating random background colors, multiple movement functions for turtle (forward, back, left, right), creating coordinates, drawing lines, changing turtle color by every move, and choosing which shape you'd like to play in the Turtle Maze Game! The game does involve a creation of using different lists, loops, structures, functions, etc. Have fun playing!
